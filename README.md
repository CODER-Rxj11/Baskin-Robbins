# Baskin Robbins Website Redesign

This project redesigns and modernizes the Baskin Robbins website for an improved user experience.


## Documentation

The goals of this redesign were to:

>>â€¢ Refresh the visual design with new colors, typography, layouts.
>â€¢ Make the site responsive for all device sizes.
>>â€¢ Add interactive elements like image sliders and smooth scrolling.
â€¢ Improve navigation and site architecture.

Popular frameworks like Bootstrap 5 and SwiperJS were used for faster development and pre-built components. The focus was on enhancing visual appeal and interactivity compared to the original static site.

Creative liberties were taken in certain areas that could be further refined for an official redesign.
